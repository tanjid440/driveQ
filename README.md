## Features:
1. The Completion Rate
2. Rogue Driver Detection
3. Banning Reckless Drivers
4. Reward Points for the Goodies
5. New Driver Registration
6. Driver Information

## Tech Stack:
Frontend : Vanilla Js ,HTML , CSS
Backend : Express Js
Database: MySql (MariaDB)

## API End-Point Numbers : 5

## Current Status:
The project is still in developement phase , not ready for production . However it is fully functional and filled with potentials .

## Bugs:
1. Only Completion ratio endpoint can handle invalid input, rest of the endpoints cannot handle invalid Inputs , it crashes the server.
2.  Unique Driver ID is generated but cannot restrict      registering same user more than once.
3. Speed slider does not work sometimes , there is a 
problem with the header if it does not work.
4. Message sometimes does not get updated during over speed.


## Future Plan:
To improve driver quality our future plan is to develope this project more

## Plan 1: 
In future we would like to connect drivers with web socket to servers and analyze real time data using AI and Machine learning to give drivers better suggestions and passengers a safe ride.

## Plan 2 : 
We would like to invite other enterprises and their products. With the help of reward points drivers will be able to get discounts or other facilities from those enterprises. And They can also reduce their warning level.
